------------------------------------

We first learned about the Riot API Challenge on May 1st. We were pretty late to

the party, but we wanted to participate in this challenge. The most difficult 

part about this challenge was honestly the fact that it was literally right 

before finals. We are both college students majoring in Physics at the 

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and given everything else we had 

on the plate, we were very stressed on time. Another challenging aspect about

this project was that Josh had very little experience with League of Legends. 

He has watched League of Legends in the past (most notably the Season 5 World

Championships) but has never played the game before. He can see himself 

enjoying League of Legends as a spectator game, but he is not interested in

playing MOBAs himself (he plays mostly indie and fps games). Communication was

a key element, so we devoted our resources into what we were good at. I (Brian),

personally do not have that much experience in coding. I am in the very early 

stages of learning Python. The only coding languages I really know (and even 

then, not to a great extent) are Java, MySQL, and HTML. 





Josh wrote the core functions of the chat bot from the ground up. We had little 

time before finals so he committed (pun intended, Phreak this is for you) multiple

hours into the project. Precious sleep was sacrificed and some study time was 

as well, but in the end, he is extremely happy with the end result of the project.

It is his dream of UIUC accepting his transfer application into the CS department,

so hopefully this also shines some light on them. His inspiration? Well, his 

inspiration is literally computer science. Ask him to code you a piece of software

that allows for space-time travel and he will do it. 




I worked on figuring out what the main features/functions of the bot would be. The

mastery point system is relatively new, so it was hard thinking of something that

would work well with it. In the end the chat bot became a practical tool for gamers

that play League of Legends to use Discord as a way of getting information from 

Riot's API while chatting with their fellow gamers. I did my best of explaining my 

ideas to someone who has never played League of Legends before, and I am extremely

glad that everything came into fruition. 





In the future, after finals are over, we plan on adding extra features and getting 

more complex with the information you can pull from the bot. As of now, we targetted 

the bot towards the entire League userbase. Meaning that we didn't shorten any 

acronyms, we made sure that everything was accessible, easily readable, and most 

importantly: clear. Hopefully with the game knowledge that I have (I can be a 

very competitive player, and I know a lot about the game -- this is what I can 

really bring to the table) we can create tools that are far better and more complex 

than any other tool out there.
