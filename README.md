Discrank, when Blitzcrank puts the crank in Discord. 

Our project is a Discord chat bot that utilizes Riot's API to provide information about other summoners through Discord. The bot can retrieve basic summoner information as well as detailed information about current games and recent games. The bot sorts through and formats data in a pleasant fashion that makes it easy and practical to use Discord to extract information. 

The main feature (as of now) with this chat bot is the !blitz command. This retrieves data on a summoner. If they are in a live game, it retrieves information about the live game. If they are not in a live game but you request extra information about that game, it gives detailed statistics about their most recent game. There is a !help command that lists this in its entirety. 

Another main feature that utilizes mastery data is the -mastery flag. This command pulls information about a user's top mastery champions and basic information about them. 

Who doesn't like free things that usually cost money? The -chests flag gathers and lists champions that a summoner has not yet received a chest for.

A side feature is the !challenge command. This command utilizes mastery data and ranked data and puts two players' stats against one another. 

Here are some examples of the commands in action
