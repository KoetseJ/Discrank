!challenge <summoner1> <summoner2> <champion1> <champion2>

value1 = (mastery_level_of_champion_1) * ln[mastery_point_of_champion1] * ln[total_games_played_of_champion1];
value2 = (mastery_level_of_champion_2) * ln[mastery_point_of_champion2] * ln[total_games_played_of_champion2];

total = value1 + value2;

generatedNumber = random.random() * total; // Should return a value from 0 to total.

if (generatedNumber < value1)
    summoner1 wins
if (generatedNumber > value1)
    summoner2 wins
else
    What are the odds of this even happening? Tie? 

So essentially the odds should calculate out to be like this:

Chance of summoner 1 winning =
(value1)/total
Chance of summoner 2 winning =
(value2)/total
